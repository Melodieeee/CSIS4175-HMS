The pupose of this app is to provide pet owners with a social media platform where owners can exchange information on pets while still being able to perform instagram features related to their beloved pets. Pet owners can not only upload videos and pictures of their pets, but can also post requests to find mates for their pets, search for other owners who are willing to look after their pets while they are away, or even search for blog articles on how to better take care of their pets.

**GitHub:**
1. Before you start coding, get the most recent version of the project (Fetch Origin -> Pull Origin)
2. Create a new branch named with the following convention (Your Name - Feature You Are Working On, Ex: Cindy-Login Page-Tasks-Section)
3. Once You are done with the feature, test it to make sure it works without any issues
4. Create a Pull request (once approved this will merge your branch with the main branch)
5. Notify others so they can review changes (at least 1 review and approval is required before merging is allowed)
6. Once Approved your branch will be merged to main
7. Delete the old branch, now your features are added to the main project. (so the repo is not cluttered with a lot of old branches)
8. When others ask for review, make sure to go over their changes (ideally together), and test the feature. Don't approve without making sure the changes aren't messing up the project.
